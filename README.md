A simple Max4Live device which uses standard midicc to control the filter on
the Deepmind series of synths.
I've included an Ableton midi effects rack with macros mapped


This is my first attempt at making a Max4Live device. Feedback is welcome
In order for this to work properly make user your Deepmind is set to cc and not nrpn. There are 2 locations where this can be set. Under midi and under usb midi
